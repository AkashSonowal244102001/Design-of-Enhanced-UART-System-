# Design-of-Enhanced-UART-System-
Configurable UART Transmitter (TX), Receiver (RX), and Baud Generator with parameterizable TX/RX FIFOs. Includes a SystemVerilog verification environment with scoreboard, constrained-random stimulus, and corner-case coverage.

ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project implements an Enhanced UART IP Core designed for FPGA/ASIC integration. It supports reliable data transfer through configurable FIFOs, handles corner cases like overflow/underflow, and is fully verified using modern SystemVerilog testbench practices.

The motivation was to build a reusable, robust, and parameterized UART that can be plugged into larger SoCs or FPGA designs while showcasing design + verification skills.
